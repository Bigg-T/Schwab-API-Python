<h2 id="common-issues">Common Issues</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Problem: unauthorized error <code>{'errors': [{'id': 'XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX', 'status': 401, 'title': 'Unauthorized', 'detail': 'Client not authorized'}]}</code><br>Cause: You do not have access to both APIs and are attempting to access one that you have not added to your app.<br>Fix: Add both APIs "Accounts and Trading Production" and "Market Data Production" to your app.<br>Cause: The access token is expired, sometimes Schwab invalidates tokens when they make backend changes.<br>Fix: Manually update access token by changing the date in <code>tokens.json</code> or update both tokens by calling <code>client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)</code></p>
<p>Problem: Trying to sign into account and get error message: "We are unable to complete your request. Please contact customer service for further assistance."<br>Problem: "Whitelabel Error Page This application has no configured error view, so you are seeing this as a fallback." (status=500)<br>Fix: Your app is "Approved - Pending", you must wait for status "Ready for Use".<br>Note: Or you <em>could</em> have an account type that is not supported by the Schwab API.</p>
<p>Problem: SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED - self-signed certificate in certificate chain error when connecting to streaming server<br>Fix: For MacOS you must run the python certificates installer: <code>open /Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command</code></p>
<p>Problem: Issues with option contracts in api calls or streaming:<br>Fix: You are likely not following the format for option contracts.<br>Option contract format: Symbol (6 characters including spaces!) | Expiration (6 characters) | Call/Put (1 character) | Strike Price (5+3=8 characters)</p>
<p>Problem: "{"error":"unsupported_token_type","error_description":"400 Bad Request: \"{\"error_description\":\"Exception while authenticating refresh token..."<br>Problem: "Could not get new access token (1 of 3)." (or x of 3 etc)<br>Cause: Your refresh token is invalid (maybe you created a new refresh token on a different machine).<br>Fix: Manually update refresh token by changing the date in <code>tokens.json</code> or by calling <code>client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)</code></p>
<p>Problem: "can't register atexit after shutdown"<br>Cause: The main thread dies before the stream thread starts<br>Fix: Add a delay after starting or sending a request, something to let the stream thread start up before the main thread closes.</p>
<p>Problem: API calls throwing errors despite access token and refresh token being valid / not expired.<br>Fix: Manually update refresh / access tokens by calling <code>client.tokens.update_tokens(force=True)</code>; You can also delete the tokens.json file.</p>
<p>Problem: Streaming ACCT_ACTIVITY yields no responses.<br>Fix: This is a known issue on Schwab's end.</p>
<p>Problem: After signing in, you get a "Access Denied" web page.<br>Fix: Your callback url is likely incorrect due to a slash "/" at the end.</p>
<p>Problem: App Registration Error<br>Fix: email Schwab (traderapi@schwab.com)</p>
<p>Problem: Issue in streaming with websockets - "Unsupported extension: name = permessage-deflate, params = []"<br>Cause: You are using a proxy that is blocking streaming or your DNS is not correctly resolving.<br>Fix: Change DNS servers (Google's are known-working) or change/bypass proxy.</p>
<p>Problem: "{'fault': {'faultstring': 'Body buffer overflow', 'detail': {'errorcode': 'protocol.http.TooBigBody'}}}"<br>Cause: The call that you made exceeds the amount of data that can be returned.<br>Example: The call <code>print(client.option_chains("$SPX").json())</code> returns too much data and will exceed the buffer size.<br>Fix: Add additional parameters to limit the amount of data returned.</p>
<p>Problem: refresh token expiring in 7 days is too short. - I know. </p>
